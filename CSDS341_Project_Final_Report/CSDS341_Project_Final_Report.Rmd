# Introduction
In recent decades, the growing demand for leisure and business travel has led to the prosperity of the airline market. An increasing number of people have been choosing to take flights to travel domestically or internationally. Therefore, an organized and comprehensive database that stores the airline system is critical for both travelers and crew to obtain plenty of simultaneous information.
	
Although there do exist several flight databases or applications for commercial airlines, it is rare to find comprehensive information - including weather at the departure airport and destination, aircraft type, the total flight hours of pilots, and the number of luggage allowed - in just one database. This information offers travelers a chance to be better prepared for traveling.
	
Since our airline querying system contains a relatively extensive data sets, the crew members who choose to use our database are able to access the basic information about the travelers who will be on their flight and provides updates about the airline information. 

# Database High-Level Design
## Assumptions
In order to simulate the real-world situation of a complex flight system, we need to design our database based on the following assumptions. These assumptions can also be used as references for all data constraints.

1. Assume that there have and only have two types of users of the airline querying system: travelers and crew.
		
2. Assume that plane ticket information is stored in the database system and each ticket is only valid for one traveler. However, a traveler may own zero or more plane tickets.
		
3. Assume that each ticket contains a specific seat location for exactly one flight. However, a flight may have multiple tickets being sold to travelers.   
		
4. Assume that a crew member can be either an air attendant or a pilot. Therefore, a crew member can serve zero or more flights. Additionally, a flight must be served by at least one crew member. It does have a slight chance that a small propeller airplane only needs one crew member (i.e. the pilot).
		
5. Assume that a flight is operated by exactly one aeroplane. For example, the aircraft with registration number B-6075 is operating a specific flight (flight number: CA862) from Beijing(PEK) to Geneva(GVA). However, it is likely that one aeroplane can fly multiple flights. Notice that the registration number is unique for each aeroplane.
		
6. Assume that an aeroplane can only belong to one company. Additionally, a airline company can have multiple planes. 
		
7. Assume that each airline company must have at least one airport as its hub, a place where the headquarter of the company locates and where the aeroplanes get maintenance and repaired. However, some large airports can provide services for multiple airline companies. For example, Los Angeles International Airport (LAX) is a hub for both United and Delta Airlines, and Delta Airlines has another hub : Detroit Metropolitan Airport (DTW).
		
8. Assume that each flight can have multiple schedules, and a schedule can be mapped to multiple flights. It is common for most domestic flights to have the same flight flying the same route on two successive days. There is also a slight chance that two flights have the exact same schedule.
		
9. Assume that each flight only departures from exactly one airport and only arrives at exactly one airport. However, an airport can have many flights.

## Data Description
Our database consists of seven entities, eight relationships, and one identifying relationship. Notice that some tables and relationships are merged together to reduce redundancy.

`Travelers` and `Crew` are considered as users of our airline user system. `Travelers` contains each travelers' information such as `credits`, `citizenship`, etc. `Crew`, sharing part of the attributes with `Travelers`, also has its unique attributes such as `ssn` and `salary`. Note that each user should be either a Traveler or a Crew. A user cannot be both or none, which means that if a `user_id` has already been stored in `Travelers` table, it will not be present in the `Crew` Table.

Note: In order to prevent redundancy for table ``Tickets_book_for``, since both the book and for relationships are one-to-many relationships, they are merged with the entity on many side which is ``Tickets``. This table includes three different foreign keys, such as ``traveler_id`` from the ``book`` relationship; ``regis_no`` and ``flight_no`` from ``for`` relationship. Additionally, ``Tickets`` involves in both ``for`` and ``book`` relationship as total participation, while ``Travellers`` (in ``book`` relationship) and ``Flights`` (in ``for`` relationship) are partial relationship. 



## Primary Key Constraints

1. The primary key attribute of the entities ``Travelers`` and ``Crew*`` are both ``user_id`` which is distinct for each one of the travelers, so each user can be uniquely identified by his/her ``user_id``.

2. The  entity ``Airport`` stores the information of airports and has a primary key attribute ``iata_code`` which stands for the unique three-character International Air Transport Association Code for each airport.

3. The primary key attribute of the ``Airlines*`` is ``company_id`` which stores the information of airline companiesis and is unique for each airline.

4. The primary key attribute of the ``Schedules`` is ``schedule_id`` which is unique for each schedule.

5. The primary key attribute of the ``Aeroplanes_belong`` is ``regis_no``.

6. The primary key attribute of the ``Flights_ariv_dept`` is ``regis_no`` and ``flight_no``.

7. The primary key attribute of the ``Tickets_book_for`` is ``ticket_id``.

8. The primary key attribute of the ``serve`` is ``crew_id``, ``regin_no`` and ``flight_no``.

9. The primary key attribute of the ``assign`` is ``regis_no``, ``flight_no`` and ``schedule_id``.

10. The primary key attribute of the ``hub*`` is ``company_id`` and ``iata_code``.

## Overlap Constraint

A ``User`` can be either ``Travelers`` or ``Crew``, but they share the same primary key attribute ``user_id``, so when a ``Travelers`` or a ``Crew`` is created, they have their unique ``user_id``.

## Foreign key constraints (please also check the schema for more details):

1. The ``Tickets_book_for`` schema has three foreign-key constraints: (1)``traveler_id`` references the primary key of the ``book`` relationship which is ``Travelers.user_id``. (2)``regin_no`` references the primary key of the ``for`` relationship which is ``Aeroplanes_belong.regis_no``. (3)``flight_no`` reference the primary key of the ``for`` relationship which is ``Flights_ariv_dept.flight_no``.
  
2. The ``Aeroplanes_belong`` schema has one foreign-key constraint: attribute ``company_id`` references the primary key of the ``Airlines`` which is ``Airlines.company_id``.

3. The ``Flights_ariv_dept`` schema has three foreign-key constraints: (1)``regis_no`` references the primary key of the ``Aeroplanes_belong`` relationship which is ``Aeroplanes_belong.regis_no``. (2)``dept_iata_code`` references the primary key of the ``Airports`` entity which is ``Airports.iata_code``. (3)``ariv_iata_code`` reference the primary key of the ``Airports`` entity which is ``Airports.iata_code``.

4. The ``serve`` schema has three foreign-key constraints: (1)``crew_id`` references the primary key of the ``Crew`` entity which is ``Crew.user_id``. (2)``regis_no`` references the primary key of the ``Aeroplanes_belong`` relationship which is ``Aeroplanes_belong.regis_no``. (3)``flight_no`` reference the primary key of the ``Flights_ariv_dept`` entity which is ``Flights_ariv_dept.flight_no``.

5. The `assign` schema has three foreign-key constraints: (1)`chedule_i`` references the primary key of the ``Schedules`` entity which is ``Schedules.schedule_id``. (2)``regis_no`` references the primary key of the ``Aeroplanes_belong`` relationship which is ``Aeroplanes_belong.regis_no``. (3)``flight_no`` reference the primary key of the ``Flights_ariv_dept`` relationship which is ``Flights_ariv_dept.flight_no``.

6. The `hub` schema has three foreign-key constraints: (1)`company_id` references the primary key of the `Airlines` entity which is `Airlines.company_id`. (2)`iata_code` references the primary key of the `Airports` entity which is `Aeroplanes_belong.regis_no`.

## Mapping cardinalities (please also check the ER-Diagram for more details):

1. `book` in `Tickets_book_for`is a many-to-one relationship set from `Tickets` to `Travelers`, meaning that a travelers can book multiple tickets for flights.

2. `for` in `Tickets_book_for` is a many-to-one relationship set from `Tickets` to `Flights`, meaning that a flight can have many tickets.

3. `serve` is a many-to-many relationship set from `Crew` to `Flights`, meaning that several crews can work on one flights, and one crew can work on several flights.

4. `depart` and `arrive` in `Flights_ariv_dept` are many-to-one relationship set from `Flights` to `Airports`, meaning that several flights can depart from the same airports.

5. `assign` is a many-to-one relationship set from `Flights` to `Schedules`, meaning that several different flights can have the same schedule of event.

6. `fly` is a many-to-one relationship set from `Flights` to `Aeroplanes`, meaning that several different flights can correspond to one planes.

7. `belong` is a many-to-one relationship set from `Aeroplanes` to `Airlines`, meaning that several planes can have the same airline.

8. `hub` is a many-to-many relationship set from `Airlines` to `Airports`, meaning that airline companies can have several of their hub airports, and airports can be the hub airport of several different airlines companies.

## Participation Constraints (please also check the ER-Diagram and Schema for more details):

1. `Tickets` must have a total participation in the `book` and `for` relationship set, because every travelers must have at least one ticket, and every tickets must at least for one flight.

2. `Flights` is a weak entity and totally participates in identifying relationship set `fly` with `Aeroplanes`, since a flight must at least corresponds to one plane.

3. `Flights` must have a total participation in the `depart`, `arrive` and `assign` relationship set, because an airport cannot have no flight for departure or arrival, and the existence of a schedule must have at least on flights relates to.

4. `Flights` must also a total participation in `serve`, because there should be at least a crew member to take care of a flight.

5. `Aeroplanes` must have a total participation in the `belong` relationship set, since each one of the planes should relate to their airlines company.

6. `Airlines` must have a total participation in the `hub` relationship set, meaning that there should be at least one airline company that the airport is the hub of its planes.
