# Introduction
In recent decades, the growing demand for leisure and business travel has led to the prosperity of the airline market. An increasing number of people have been choosing to take flights to travel domestically or internationally. Therefore, an organized and comprehensive database that stores the airline system is critical for both travelers and crew to obtain plenty of simultaneous information.
	
Although there do exist several flight databases or applications for commercial airlines, it is rare to find comprehensive information - including weather at the departure airport and destination, aircraft type, the total flight hours of pilots, and the number of luggage allowed - in just one database. This information offers travelers a chance to be better prepared for traveling.
	
Since our airline querying system contains a relatively extensive data sets, the crew members who choose to use our database are able to access the basic information about the travelers who will be on their flight and provides updates about the airline information. 

# Database High-Level Design
## Assumptions
In order to simulate the real-world situation of a complex flight system, we need to design our database based on the following assumptions. These assumptions can also be used as references for all data constraints.

1. Assume that there have and only have two types of users of the airline querying system: travelers and crew.
		
2. Assume that plane ticket information is stored in the database system and each ticket is only valid for one traveler. However, a traveler may own zero or more plane tickets.
		
3. Assume that each ticket contains a specific seat location for exactly one flight. However, a flight may have multiple tickets being sold to travelers.   
		
4. Assume that a crew member can be either an air attendant or a pilot. Therefore, a crew member can serve zero or more flights. Additionally, a flight must be served by at least one crew member. It does have a slight chance that a small propeller airplane only needs one crew member (i.e. the pilot).
		
5. Assume that a flight is operated by exactly one aeroplane. For example, the aircraft with registration number B-6075 is operating a specific flight (flight number: CA862) from Beijing(PEK) to Geneva(GVA). However, it is likely that one aeroplane can fly multiple flights. Notice that the registration number is unique for each aeroplane.
		
6. Assume that an aeroplane can only belong to one company. Additionally, a airline company can have multiple planes. 
		
7. Assume that each airline company must have at least one airport as its hub, a place where the headquarter of the company locates and where the aeroplanes get maintenance and repaired. However, some large airports can provide services for multiple airline companies. For example, Los Angeles International Airport (LAX) is a hub for both United and Delta Airlines, and Delta Airlines has another hub : Detroit Metropolitan Airport (DTW).
		
8. Assume that each flight can have multiple schedules, and a schedule can be mapped to multiple flights. It is common for most domestic flights to have the same flight flying the same route on two successive days. There is also a slight chance that two flights have the exact same schedule.
		
9. Assume that each flight only departures from exactly one airport and only arrives at exactly one airport. However, an airport can have many flights.

## Data Description
Our database consists of seven entities, eight relationships, and one identifying relationship. Notice that some tables and relationships are merged together to reduce redundancy.

`Travelers` and `Crew` are considered as users of our airline user system. `Travelers` contains each travelers' information such as `credits`, `citizenship`, etc. `Crew`, sharing part of the attributes with `Travelers`, also has its unique attributes such as `ssn` and `salary`. Note that each user should be either a Traveler or a Crew. A user cannot be both or none, which means that if a `user_id` has already been stored in `Travelers` table, it will not be present in the `Crew` Table. 

# Relational Schema (SQL Language):
**Table of Travelers:**
```
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS Travelers (
    user_id INT NOT NULL,
    first_name VARCHAR(50),

**Note: In order to prevent redundancy, the relational schema for relation "book" and "for" are not necessary to create by included both inside the "Tickets_book_for" table.**
