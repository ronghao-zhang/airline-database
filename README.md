# csds341-project-airlineDatabase
This repository is built for the final project for CSDS341 Introduction to Database Systems. It is a database system that contains all sorts of information about flights and airlines that can be accessed by both travelers and crew. 

## Directories Contents

1. `CSDS341_Project_Final_Report` directory contains the final report of our project. Please open the `.pdf` file to view the final report. Other files are generated when compile the `.rmd` file using R programming language. Note that the code for connecting to the database are embedded in the `rmd` file, which can also be seen in the final report. There is no separate file for printing tables to the command line interface.

2. `CSDS341_Project_Initial_Report` directory contains the initial report of our project, which has already been submitted via canvas.

3. `CSDS341_Project_Backup_Data` directory contains the data that needs to be input into the database. The `.R` or `.Rmd` file are used to process or simulate data. The `raw_data` directory contains raw data files obtained from open sources, while the `csv_data` directory contains the processed data files in `.csv` format that are ready for data import. 

4. `CSDS341_Project_Code` directory contains `.sql` code that can be used in `MySQL BenchWork 8.0 CE` for table creation and deletion.
